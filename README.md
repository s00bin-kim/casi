# CASI
Reproducing results and plots from ***Computer Age Statistical Inference***, written by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie.

This personal project is planned as an extension to course *Advanced Statistical Methods (2020 Fall)* at Seoul National University.

PDF version of the book, dataset and exercise sets are accessible via [book's website](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/index.html).

# Notes
- Since authors requested not to post solutions of exercises, I will hide codes and post only outputs of figures & results which are duplicates of sample exercises.
